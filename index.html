    <h2>House Blend Coffee</h2>

    <br>
    <p style="width:50%">House Blends can often be described as reliable and straightforward – a blend that is a “go-to” in a coffee shop. They
    are generally seen as a consistent and high-value product that you can count on. The brew of a house blend coffee is
    different than that of a breakfast blend or espresso roast – meaning that when you pour a cup of a house blend coffee,
    you should expect to fall somewhere in the middle of a light roast and dark roast and have intermediate flavor.</p>

    <h2>Capuccino Coffee</h2>

    <p style="width:50%">
    The cappuccino is a staple in coffee shops all over the world. It’s classically characterised by its dry, foamed milk
    top. However, it’s not as simple as it seems: this widely misunderstood drink has changed quite a bit over the years.The cappuccino is a classic espresso and milk drink. A common misconception is that it follows the rule of thirds:
    one-third espresso, one-third steamed milk and one-third foamed milk.</p>

    <h2>Americano Coffee</h2>

    <br>
    <p style="width:50%">
    The Americano tends to stand out amongst its espresso cousins because it doesn’t have milk in it. While some people do
    add milk, you will likely never receive an Americano with any form of dairy or dairy-alternative in it unless you
    specifically ask the barista to add it.
    
    In addition to this, an Americano can also be iced! The process is still the same, the primary difference being that
    cold water is used instead of hot, and you can plop a few ice cubes in it to cool it down further.</p>
